## Day 4-7 Preparation: Asset Production

### Tower Asset Production Strategy
**Day 4: Level 1 Assets**
- Peashooter Level 1 (64x64px, green theme)
- Sunflower Level 1 (64x64px, gold theme)  
- Wallnut Level 1 (64x64px, brown theme)

**Day 5: Level 2-3 Assets**
- Tower progression with increasing detail
- Animation frames (idle, attack)
- Visual enhancement at each level

### Enemy Asset Production Strategy
**Day 6: Core Enemy Types**

- Tank (gray, slow, high health)
- Flying (pink, medium speed)
- Boss (red, very high health)

### UI Asset Production Strategy
**Day 7: Interactive Elements**
- Button states (normal, hover, active)
- Panel designs (main, side)
- Icon set (tower types, actions)

## Performance Metrics Tracking

### Daily Targets
```
Day 1-3: System Setup
├── Validation accuracy: 100%
├── Token implementation: Complete
├── File structure: 100% compliant
└── Documentation: Complete

Day 4-7: Asset Production  
├── Tower assets: 9/9 created
├── Enemy assets: 4/4 created
├── UI elements: 20/20 created
├── Budget compliance: 100%
└── Quality metrics: 95%+
```

### Weekly Checkpoint
By end of Week 1, we should have:
- Complete design system foundation
- All core assets created and validated
- Asset pipeline fully operational
- Performance budgets met
- Team workflow established

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Asset Size Overrun**: Automated validation prevents this
- **Performance Issues**: Budget tracking ensures compliance
- **Quality Inconsistency**: Templates and guidelines enforce standards

### Team Risks
- **Skill Gap**: Beginner designer uses templates for guidance
- **Timeline Pressure**: Daily check-ins and flexible task allocation
- **Quality Control**: Senior designer review process

### Solution Strategies
- Daily standups to track progress
- Automated testing to catch issues early
- Modular approach for easy adjustments
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task

## Quality Assurance

### Daily Validation
```
Assets Created Today:
├── [ ] Follow naming conventions
├── [ ] Within size budget
├── [ ] Match design tokens
├── [ ] Validate with automated tools
└── [ ] Peer review completed

Daily Metrics:
├── [ ] Assets created vs. target
├── [ ] Budget used vs. allocation
├── [ ] Quality score
├── [ ] Performance impact
└── [ ] Team velocity
```

### End-of-Week Review
- Asset completeness: 100% of required assets
- Performance compliance: All budgets met
- Quality standards: 95%+ acceptance rate
- Team satisfaction: Positive workflow experience

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Tomorrow)
1. Senior Designer: Begin visual style guide completion
2. Beginner Designer: Start UI component template creation
3. Morning Standup: Review Day 1 achievements
4. Validation Test: Run full asset validation check

### Preparation Requirements
- Install design software (Photoshop, Figma, etc.)
- Set up compression tools (TinyPNG, etc.)
- Prepare template files for asset creation
- Configure validation scripts for daily use
