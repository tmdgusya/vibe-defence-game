## 📋 Batch Generation Tips

1. **Use consistent art style** across all assets (same artist/generator)

4. **Export settings**:
   - Format: PNG
   - Background: Transparent
   - Color mode: RGBA
   - DPI: 72 (web standard)

5. **File naming convention**:

   ```
   Enemies: enemy-basic.png, enemy-tank.png, enemy-flying.png, etc.
   Towers: tower-sunflower-1.png, tower-sunflower-2.png, tower-sunflower-3.png, etc.
   Projectiles: projectile-pea.png, projectile-mortar.png
   ```

6. **Save location**:
   ```
   /public/assets/enemies/
   /public/assets/towers/
   /public/assets/projectiles/

## 🚀 Integration Instructions

After generating images:

1. Create asset directories:

```bash
mkdir -p public/assets/enemies
mkdir -p public/assets/towers
mkdir -p public/assets/projectiles
```

2. Place images in respective folders

3. Update `BootScene.ts` to load images instead of generating graphics

4. Update texture keys in code to match new image files

Let me know when assets are ready and I'll integrate them into the game!
